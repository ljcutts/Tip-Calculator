## Overview
This is my 3rd coding project/challenge and first project that I used Vanilla Javascript. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process
I first set up the body of the app and made sure to add the background color. Then made a main HTML element and start styling it with it's size, along with using CSS Grid. I made sure that the main element had to two sides with the same sizes but of course different properties. I first worked on the left side which has all the inputs and a couple of the svg images. Then I worked on the right side which gives you the total tip amount. Once I liked the CSS I had for the app and had all the buttons and inputs coded in, I worked on the Javascript(functionality). I started using the document property so that I can target different HTML elements. Then I focused a lot on making sure the amounts on the right side of the app changed values based on the bill and tip percentage on the left side. I started adding event listeners to the HTML elements I targeted and also added alerts and extra functionality if the user were to try to input a number 0 or less than 0.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla Javascript(Event Listeners)

### What I learned

I learned how to implement Javascript Event Listeners and how to use Javascript to mainpulate CSS properties.


### Continued development

I'm getting a lot more comfortable with HTML and CSS. But as far as CSS, I didn't make this compatible for mobile phones(media screen property). I want to make sure I implement that in my upcoming projects, along with doing projects that help test and practice your Javascript skills.
